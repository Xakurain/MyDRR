  Building Custom Rule F:/code/python/iMIA/MyDRR/CUDA_DigitallyReconstructedRadiographs/SiddonClassLib/src/CMakeLists.txt
  CMake is re-running because F:/code/python/iMIA/MyDRR/CUDA_DigitallyReconstructedRadiographs/SiddonClassLib/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'F:/code/python/iMIA/MyDRR/CUDA_DigitallyReconstructedRadiographs/SiddonClassLib/build/CMakeFiles/SiddonGpu.dir/SiddonLib/SiddonGpu_generated_siddon_class.cu.obj.depend'

  -- Selecting Windows SDK version 10.0.22000.0 to target Windows 10.0.22621.
  CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  -- Configuring done
    No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as
  
      cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
  
    should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
    if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
    information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
  
  CMake Warning (dev) at D:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.25/Modules/FindCUDA.cmake:1989 (add_library):
    Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as
  
      if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
        cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
      endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)
  
    as early as possible but after the most recent call to
    cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
    because target "SiddonGpu" links to some libraries for which the linker
    must search:
  
      cudart, cudadevrt
  
    and other libraries with known full path:
  
      D:/Program Files/NVIDIA/CUDA/v11.6/lib/x64/cudart_static.lib
  
    CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
    case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
    compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
    or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
    more information.
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    CMakeLists.txt:8 (cuda_add_library)
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
